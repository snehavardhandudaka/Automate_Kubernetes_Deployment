# Automate_Kubernetes_Deployment
Tech word with Nana project.

Certainly! Here’s a more conversational and human-friendly description:

### Describe the Project

In this project, you built a system for automatically deploying and managing applications on a Kubernetes cluster using AWS EKS. You set up everything from scratch, including the cluster and the compute resources it needs. You then automated the setup of these resources and the deployment of your applications using Terraform and Ansible. 

The end result is a streamlined process where updates to your applications are automatically handled, keeping everything running smoothly and efficiently. This project demonstrates how to integrate cloud services, automation tools, and container orchestration to build a modern, scalable deployment environment for applications.

### What Did You Build?

In this project, you set up an automated system to deploy and manage applications using Kubernetes on AWS. Here’s a breakdown of what you built:

1. **AWS EKS Cluster**: 
   - You created a Kubernetes cluster on AWS using Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). This cluster acts like a powerful manager that runs and oversees your containerized applications.

2. **Node Groups**: 
   - You set up node groups within this cluster. These are essentially collections of virtual machines that provide the computing power needed to run your apps.

3. **Automated Infrastructure**:
   - **Terraform Scripts**: You wrote scripts with Terraform to automate the creation of all the AWS resources you needed. This includes everything from the cluster itself to the networking components like VPCs and subnets.
   - **Ansible Playbooks**: You used Ansible to automate deploying your applications onto Kubernetes. This means setting up your applications, managing their lifecycle, and ensuring they run smoothly.

4. **Application Deployment**:
   - You got a sample app up and running on your Kubernetes cluster. This involved creating various Kubernetes resources to manage the app’s deployment and operation.

5. **Continuous Deployment**:
   - You set up a process for automatically deploying updates to your application. This makes sure your app is always running the latest version without you having to manually intervene.

### What Have You Learned?

Through this project, you picked up several valuable skills and insights:

1. **Kubernetes and EKS**:
   - **Kubernetes Basics**: You learned how Kubernetes works, including key components like pods, deployments, and services.
   - **EKS Management**: You got hands-on experience managing an EKS cluster, including scaling and configuring node groups.

2. **Infrastructure Automation**:
   - **Terraform**: You mastered using Terraform to automate the setup and management of AWS resources. This helps ensure your infrastructure is set up correctly and consistently.
   - **Ansible**: You used Ansible to handle deploying applications and managing Kubernetes resources, which simplifies and speeds up the deployment process.

3. **Cloud Integration**:
   - **AWS Services**: You learned how to integrate Kubernetes with AWS services, setting up things like VPCs, subnets, and IAM roles to keep everything running smoothly and securely.
   - **Resource Management**: You became skilled at managing and monitoring cloud resources to keep your applications performing well.

4. **Troubleshooting and Debugging**:
   - **Issue Resolution**: You improved your ability to troubleshoot problems related to node setup, pod scheduling, and deployment issues.
   - **Cluster Operations**: You learned how to operate and maintain a Kubernetes cluster, handling issues like node failures and scaling challenges.

5. **Best Practices**:
   - **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: You saw firsthand how using IaC tools like Terraform ensures your infrastructure is consistent and easy to reproduce.
   - **Automated Deployment**: You experienced the benefits of automating deployments, which helps keep your applications updated with minimal manual work.
